# Traffic tracker

A little tool to help Cushing try out the birthday problem with cars - how many cars should you expect to drive past before having a 50% chance of seeing the same string of final 3 letters twice?

Type the registration of each car you see (or just the last three letters), and it'll tell you when you see a double.
